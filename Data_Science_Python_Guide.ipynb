        "Before we look at the Python programming language, let's dig in a bit into its history. Python was developed by Guido Van Rossum in the late 80's. Its design is mainly focused on readability and easness-of-use. For this reason, some compromises had to be made which result in certain aspects of the language being affected, mainly performance. Nonetheless, Python's clear an easy syntax allow for very quick prototyping, thus attracting developers and researchers alike.\n",

        "### Print\n",
        "Now that we've briefly introduced the Python programming language, let's work on getting some infomration onto the screen. One of the first--if not the first--programs that developers learn to code is the \"hello world\" program. Python has an in-built function (we'll learn more about those in a while) called the `print` function. This function takes in a string of characters, for example, the text `\"How are you today?\"` is a string of characters. That being said, let's look at how to use the `print` function in Python."
